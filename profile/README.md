## 🧠 What Is a Triggerbot in Rust?

A **Triggerbot** is a cheat that auto-shoots the second your crosshair hovers over a valid hitbox. You’re still aiming manually, but the second that head or chest is in sight – it **fires instantly**.

This keeps things looking legit, but **gives you the reaction time of a robot**. It’s like having a silent teammate pulling the trigger for you.
